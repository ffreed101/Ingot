# Ingot

 A budgeting and expense tracking CLI tool made with python.

## Description

As a new developer, I wanted to apply my skills I gained from college and from personal studies to something I could use and even build upon in the future. As a young man, keeping up with finances is vital to my individual growth. That's why I decided to make this budgeting app. It's more of a personal project for fun than anything. This app in its current state is a command line tool that allows users to create a user profile with a name, balance, fixed expenses(not much use for fixed expenses yet). For these profiles, you can create, edit, and delete transactions as your balance dynamically updates to adjust
